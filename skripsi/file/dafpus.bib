abstract = {Many species of fish schools organize for short or longer periods of time without a leader. We searched for the behaviour patterns of the individual fish, which allow movement of such a school. On the basis of biological facts we constructed a number of behaviour models and tested them with computer simulations against biological reality. Basic assumptions of our simulations are: (1) The motion of a fish is only influenced by the position and orientation of its nearest neighbours. (2) The new velocity and the turning angle of each fish (after a time step) are calculated by probability distributions taking into account random influences. (3) The movement of each model fish is based upon the same behaviour model, i.e. the modelled fish group swims without a leader. The basic behaviour patterns are attraction, repulsion and parallel orientation. Our investigations show that it is very important how a fish mixes the influences of its neighbours. If a fish averages the influences of its neighbours, the model fish group shows the typical characteristics of a real fish school: strong cohesion and high degree of polarization. If a fish only responds to a single neighbour, the model creates a confused fish group.}

abstract = {Simulation models help to understand how individual interactions can lead to selforganization of large, moving polarized schools of fish. To some extend the underlying mechanisms in these models are still hypothetical. This paper investigates and confirms previously published results and suggests an alternative model. Previous models of fish schools used the assumption that individuals modify their swimming direction and speed as a reaction to a small fixed number of other individuals swimming closest to their own swimming direction (front priority). They also used discrete transitions between different reaction types to their neighbours (see Huth and Wissel, this volume). These models are able to simulate school movement in a homogeneous environment but fail under certain heterogeneous conditions (e.g. when schools meet obstacles) and do not adequately simulate the formation process of schools. We present an alternative model, in which a fish's new speed and swimming direction is influenced by all visible neighbours. Each neighbour contributes a vector component weighted according to its distance. These components are aggregated to determine to what extent the different behavioural modes of searching, attraction, parallel orientation and repulsion contribute to a modification of an individual's movement in a particular situation. The resulting model reproduces schooling behaviour, organization of schools and has fewer artificial requirements concerning a biological interpretation of the underlying mechanisms. It shows how a comparison of different modelling approaches, empirical observation of inter-organismic interaction, and physiological research can stimulate each other in order to understand a complex, dynamic phenomenon.}

      first-year graduate students, this book can be used for
      students majoring in statistics who have a solid

      stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
      being more concerned with understanding basic statistical
      concepts and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for
      a variety of situations, and less concerned with formal

The results from the simulation are obtained and the influence of the predictor variables of the evacuation process (pedestrian flow and Tawaf duration) on the responses (pedestrian density, average walking speed, and cumulative evacuee) is investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). The average results from the experiments with an rms error less than 0.5 are obtained from the RSM. Its performance indicates that the RSM possesses excellent predictive ability for the model evacuation study, because both the experimental and the predicted values agree well with the results obtained in this study.}

This paper presents a review of studies directed at the characterization of crowd behavior and movement. It appears that the theory of pedestrian traffic flow, for orderly movement under normal conditions, has been sufficiently developed to reflect the actual behavior of foot traffic flows in such context, and thus can be adopted for design and control purposes. On the other hand, the review reveals that virtually no scientific basis appears to be available in the literature to design and analyze strategies for the management of very large crowds associated with special events. The review of relevant Hajj studies shows that very limited research has been directed at crowd behavior and movement during the Hajj. Modelling capabilities are needed there to help better understand this unique phenomena, and thus prevent the occurrence of more crowding tragedies. The challenge for any future research, then, is to develop useful and accurate means for predicting normal crowd behavior, and for enabling facility managers and designers to evaluate various scenarios before costly mistakes are made.}

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes the design and development of a cleaning robot, using adaptive manufacturing technology and its use with a control algorithm for which there is a stability proof. The authors’ goal was to fill the gap between theory and practical implementation based on available low-cost components. Adaptive manufacturing was chosen to cut down the cost of manufacturing the robot. Practical verification of the effectiveness of the control algorithm was achieved with the experiments. The robot comprises mainly three assemblies, a four-wheel-drive platform, a four-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm, and a vacuum system. The inlet pipe of the vacuum system was attached to the end effector of the robotic arm, which makes the robot more flexible to clean uneven areas, such as skirting on floors. The robot was equipped with a LIDAR sensor and web camera, giving the opportunity to develop more complex methods. A low-level proportional–integral–derivative (PID) speed controller was implemented, and a high-level controller that uses artificial potential functions to generate repulsive components, which avoids collision with obstacles. Robot operating system (ROS) was installed in the robot’s on-board system. With the help of the ROS node, the high-level controller generates control signals for the low-level controller.},
